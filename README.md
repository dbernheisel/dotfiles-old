# Customizations (Dotfiles)

## OSX

### dot files
Starting with Prezto, then added my own theme and put my secrets into a file (not uploaded here :smirk:)

Use this font for awesomeness: Inconsolata+Awesome.ttf


### cd to
![cd to Finder app](images/cd_to.png)

This small app will allow you to open up Terminal/iTerm from which folder you're currently at within Finder. This is essential!

### Sublime Text Icon Replacement

This just looks better in my dock. I like it.
Obviously, you'll need [Sublime Text](www.sublimetext.com/3)

### iTerm2
[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html) is great, and I use the beta version (at this time, 2.9.20151001 beta) because of El Capitan compatibility.

Included is an exported JSON from iTerm of my profiles. You'll probably want to change a couple things, like the starting directory. I have a chromebox for gaming, and a Raspberry Pi for serving local media off a slow NAS.
